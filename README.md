# OnlyOffice_projectList
A single page PHP script that queries OnlyOffice and displays projects with detail.

To use you will need to create your API authentication token per the following:
https://api.onlyoffice.com/portals/auth

Save the token in authtoken.txt.

Edit the $baseURL variable at the very top of the PHP script to match the hostname of your
OnlyOffice server.

Put the PHP script and authtoken.txt on your webserver and open in a browser.

Finally, fork, add features and send the best stuff back upstream :)
