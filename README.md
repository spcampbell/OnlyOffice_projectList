# OnlyOffice_projectList
PHP script that queries OnlyOffice and displays projects with detail.

To use you will need to create your API authentication token per the following:
https://api.onlyoffice.com/portals/auth

Then...

1. Save the token in authtoken.txt.

2. Edit the $baseURL variable at the very top of the PHP script to match the hostname of your
OnlyOffice server.

3. Put the PHP script, theme.css and authtoken.txt on your webserver and open in a browser.

Finally, fork, add features and send the best stuff back upstream :)
